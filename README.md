## Official Resources

* **[CompVis/Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)** - The official release of Stable Diffusion including a CLI, an AI-based Safety Classifier, which detects and suppresses sexualized content, and all the necessary files to get running.
* [stability-AI/stability-sdk](https://github.com/stability-AI/stability-sdk) - The official SDK used to build python applications integrated with StabilityAI's cloud platform instead of hosting the model locally. Operation requires an API Key (üñäÔ∏èüíµ).

## Actively Maintained Forks and Containers

All forks listed here add additional features and optimisations and are generally faster than the original release, as they keep the model in memory rather than reloading it after every prompt. Most forks seem to remove the Safety Classifier which may present a risk if used to provide public-facing services, such as Discord bots.

  * [txt2imghd](https://github.com/jquesnelle/txt2imghd) - Fork of progrock diffusion that creates detailed, higher-resolution images by first generating an image from a prompt, upscaling it, then running img2img on smaller pieces of the upscaled image, and blending the results back into the original image.
